# Candidate-Search

### Description
I completed the front-end code for a job candidate search application using TypeScript. This application fetches data from the GitHub API and displays details about a candidate, including their name, username, location, avatar, email, GitHub profile link, and company. Users can choose to save the candidate to the 'Potential Candidates' page or reject them. The 'Potential Candidates' page stores and displays all saved candidates in a table, where users also have the option to remove candidates.
